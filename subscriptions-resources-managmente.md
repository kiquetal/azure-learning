#### Why VM over containers

  With VM's you host a Linux machine on Windows ,or a Windows machine on macOS, giving greater flexitibiliy.
  VMs allow you to host multiple applications, with tight integration in a single VM.
  Containers traditionally only host single applications.
  In containers applications have to run on the same OS, as the host computer.
  VMs are less efficient than containers.
